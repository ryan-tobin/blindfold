# Blindfold

> Work in progress for NEAR HACKATHON (Nov 1 to Nov 14, 2026). Sections marked _TBD_ are filled in as the build lands.

Blindfold is a private data room where AI agents pay per question for differentially private answers from encrypted data held in a TEE, with payments, limits and receipts on NEAR. **Answers, not data.**

_TBD: 30-second GIF and demo video link._

## Tracks entered and why

- **Privacy & Private AI (primary):** _TBD_
- **Agent Economy:** _TBD_
- **AI Security & Defense:** _TBD_

## Quickstart

Prerequisites: Python 3.11+, Java 17+ (for Synthea), make. Docker and Node arrive with later days.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && pip install -e "./engine[dev]"
make data   # downloads Synthea v4.0.0, generates 10,000 synthetic patients, builds 5 tables
make test   # unit tests
make sql    # check the demo question and show the SQL it compiles to
```

## What you should see

`make data` takes about 15–25 minutes the first time: it downloads Synthea (191 MB), writes about 1.2 GB of CSVs to `data/synthea/csv/`, then builds the five analytic tables and prints their row counts. Synthea runs with a fixed seed, reference and end date, and time zone (UTC), so you should get these exact numbers on any machine, on any day:

```text
Built .../data/riverside.duckdb
  patients         10,000 rows
  admissions      270,648 rows
  conditions        8,524 rows
  medications       5,402 rows
  labs            325,355 rows
```

`make test` then prints `97 passed`. Before `make data` it prints `80 passed, 17 skipped`, because the checks on the real tables need the database.

`make sql` checks the demo question (`datasets/riverside/examples/readmit_diabetes_65plus_by_sex.json`), prints the parameterized SQL it compiles to, and runs it. The values it prints are the **true** answers with no noise yet; it's a developer check on the raw data, and the engine never returns these. Noise arrives on Day 3. To see a refusal instead, run `make sql SPEC=datasets/riverside/examples/attack_one_patient.json`: it prints the refusal as JSON and exits with code 2.

_TBD: expected output for each demo step._

## Architecture and data flow

_TBD_

## Privacy guarantees and how each is enforced

- **Only aggregate questions in a fixed format.** The engine accepts a QuerySpec (measure, table, filters, group-by, ε), never SQL. `engine/blindfold/spec.py` checks every name and value against `datasets/riverside/schema.json` and refuses anything else with a rule and a reason (`engine/blindfold/refuse.py`).
- **No SQL injection by construction.** `engine/blindfold/compile.py` builds SQL from a fixed template; table and column names come only from the schema, and every value is a `?` parameter.
- **One patient can move an answer only so far.** After filters, each patient keeps at most `max_rows_per_patient` rows (5 admissions, 5 lab results, …) before anything is counted, and every group-by cell is returned, including empty ones. `compile.py` reports the resulting sensitivity for the noise step.
- **No narrowing in on a person.** At most 2 group-by columns and 50 cells, at most 3 quasi-identifiers (sex, age band, ZIP3, county, admission and discharge dates) per question, and date ranges of at least 30 days.
- _TBD: differential-privacy noise (Day 3), privacy budget and replay cache (Day 4), enclave and receipts (Days 6–7)._

## Benchmark results

_TBD: table from `make bench`._

## Tests

`make test` runs the unit tests:

- `engine/tests/test_load.py` (30): table schemas, identifier removal, `readmit_30d`, category values and lab bounds.
- `engine/tests/test_spec.py` (45): valid QuerySpecs pass and normalise to one canonical form; 33 bad specs are each refused with the right rule and reason.
- `engine/tests/test_compile.py` (22): exact answers on a hand-made database, the per-patient cap, empty cells, clipping, parameterized SQL, and runs on the real tables.

_TBD: DP mechanisms, budget, contract._

## Contract and enclave measurement

_TBD: testnet contract address and enclave code hash._

## Built during the hackathon

Everything in this repository was written during NEAR HACKATHON. The first commit was made on Nov 1, 2026, inside the build window that opened with the announcement on Oct 19, 2026, and there is no code from before it. That is why there is no `pre-hackathon` tag. The final submitted state is tagged `hackathon-submission`.

## Third-party code and AI assistance

## Known limits and what's next

- All data is synthetic (Synthea). No real person's data is used, even for testing.
- Synthea has no ZIP code for some towns; those patients get `zip3 = "unknown"`.
- Contribution caps trade accuracy for privacy: a patient with more than 5 matching admissions or lab results counts only 5 (a fixed pseudo-random pick), so totals over heavy users are lower than the raw data. The benchmark measures this.
- Depression and heart failure are rare in Synthea's living population (well under 1% of patients), so most questions about them will be suppressed as small cells.
- `readmit_30d` near the end of the data (after Oct 1, 2026) can miss readmissions that happen after the data ends.
